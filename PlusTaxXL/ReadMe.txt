The Plus Tax XL ReadMe file.


Introduction
============
Plus Tax XL has a single purpose, to calculate sales tax.


Set the Tax Rate
================
After launching it for the fist time, set your local tax rate by clicking in the box to the right of
"Tax Rate" and enter the appropriate number. The sales tax rate should be entered as a percentage.

Once you enter the tax rate you can optionally hide the tax rate by opening the Options menu and
unchecking Show/Edit Tax Rate.

Now you're ready to use Plus Tax XL!


Using Plus Tax XL
=================
Simply enter the pre-tax amount and in the box to the right of Amount and press enter. The sales tax
and to total amount will be calculated.

The total amount will automatically be copied to the Windows clipboard, ready for you to
paste into another document or application. If you don't want this to happen, click on the Options
menu and uncheck "Automatically Total Copy to Clipboard".

The Options menu also has an options to keep the Plus Tax XL window on top of other windows, to
customize the title and to change the zoom level of the window.

You can also adjust the zoom level of the window by holding the Ctrl key and then pressing the numeric
keypad plus or minus keys, or by holding the Ctrl key and scrolling the mouse wheel.

The sales tax rate, copy to clipboard preference, keep on top preference, and window position
will be remembered from session to session.
